                  witter is known for its ease of use and quick spread of news and information, but it has also become a platform for hatred, trolling, 
                  and insults. In recent years, Twitter has become a hotbed of cruelty, with users attacking and abusing one another with abandon. This issue 
                  is particularly concerning, given the platform's wide reach and young users. It is important to consider why Twitter has become so full of insults 
                  and comments that lack any sense of humanity.

              </p>
            
              
              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="../../assets/img/mean.png" alt="Understanding The Prevalence of Negativity on Twitter" class="img-fluid">
              </figure>
              
              
              <p>One of the primary causes of this issue is the platform's Anonymity. People feel a sense of security and impunity when cloaked in Anonymity,
                 allowing them to write and post cruel comments without fear of retribution. Without the need to face their victims, trolls can engage in extreme
                  cruelty and harassment without facing any consequences.
              </p>


              <p>
                The platform's lack of moderation is also to blame. Twitter does not have the same restraint as other social media platforms, 
                allowing users to post whatever they like with relative impunity. This leads to a community where people feel free to share their most 
                offensive thoughts and ideas without fear of being held accountable.

              </p>

              <p>
                Finally, it is important to consider the lack of consequences for users who engage in cruel behaviour. Despite Twitter's policies against harassment
                 and bullying, the platform does not always take action against users who violate these rules. This encourages people to continue their hateful
                  behaviour, as they feel they can do so with impunity.
                   People frequently use Twitter to express their ideas and emotions to a large audience. The Anonymity of Twitter allows users to express
                    themselves freely without 
                      fear of repercussions, but it can also lead to some problematic behaviour. 

              </p>

              <p>
                One of the significant impacts of Anonymity on Twitter is an increase in cyberbullying, which is the use of electronic communication to bully a person,
                 typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. Anonymity allows users to harass and threaten other users without any 
                 consequence easily. This can lead to people feeling unsafe or uncomfortable when using the platform.

              </p>

              <p>

                Twitter has been seen not to be favourable for women over the years due to numerous factors, such as the prevalence of online harassment
                 and other forms of abuse. Women that use Twitter are more likely to experience negative interactions than men and are more likely to be targeted
                  for abuse. This has made women feel less safe, less likely to participate in online conversations, and more likely to delete their accounts.
              </p>


              <p>
                One user tweeted, 

                <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://twitter.com/resurectedsinna/status/1610959475485147137" target="_blank">
                
                  “Every time you open twitter, there’s a sub category of people getting attacked. Today it’s white feminist, tomorrow it’s light skin women
                  not dating dark skin men, the next day it’s tall women angry about short women dating all the tall men. Bruh??.”
                
                </a>
                 This tweet exemplifies the
                prevalence of online harassment on Twitter, which can cause psychological distress for many women.

              </p>


              <p>
                Various individuals have also been seen to be mean on Twitter, the popular microblogging and social networking website. Some psychological
                 reasons people may be mean on Twitter include an attempt to feel superior and a desire to fit in with their peers. 

              </p>



              <p>
                Based on the<a class="tweetLinks" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/attention-please/201401/the-ego-the-superego-the-twitter" target="_blank">


                  superego theory
                  
                  </a> , an individual may need to project a more powerful image on Twitter to influence their followers. 
                This can lead to mean tweets, as they try to appear more domineering. For example, a tweet from one user reads, 
                

                    <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://twitter.com/Amerix_DontSimp/status/1609091148403859456" target="_blank">

                          "How can a grown-up man eat Weetabix and milk? These are the men who are unable to sustain an erection. Mama's boys. Shame!” 
  
                </a>
                
                This indicates that the user is trying to make themselves seem more powerful by belittling another person.

              </p>


              <p>
                In addition, the desire to fit in with peers may lead to mean tweets. According to 
                
                <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266656123_Social_Comparison_in_Social_Media_A_Look_at_Facebook_and_Twitter" 
                target="_blank">


                  social comparison theory 
                  
                  </a>
                , individuals may feel the
                 need to compete with or compare themselves to others on Twitter. This can lead to mean tweets, as people attempt to one-up their peers or put 
                 them down in an attempt to gain favour. For instance, a tweet from one user reads, 
                 <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://twitter.com/omwambaKE/status/1577022114800013312" target="_blank">

                  “If you have not posted anything regarding Kenya Vs Uganda Violence,
                  no amount of peer pressure can influence you!”
                  
                  </a>
                
                   This tweet is likely designed to shame others into joining in on the conversation, and implies that 
                  those who are not discussing the issue are not part of the “in-crowd”. As such, this tweet can be seen as an example of how the desire to fit in 
                  can lead to mean tweets.

              </p>


              <p>
                One of the major issues facing Twitter is the problem of content moderation. This includes monitoring the platform for harassment and other forms of abuse. 
                Unfortunately, trying to track everyone who harasses or abuses other users
                 is incredibly difficult and expensive.
              </p>


              <p>
                Twitter has an algorithm that can detect potentially abusive content, but it is not 100% perfect and can be biased. For example,

                <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/year-review-content-moderation-social-media-platforms-2019" target="_blank">
                
                
                  a 2019 study
                
                </a>
                  found that the algorithm was biased against African Americans and other minority groups, resulting in more posts being
                  flagged as abusive than necessary. Moreover, the algorithm can only detect certain types of abuse and not others, such as cyberbullying
                   or hate speech. 

              </p>


              <p>
                Given the sheer volume of tweets and other content on Twitter, it is nearly impossible for the platform to completely eliminate abuse. 
                Therefore, the platform has to rely on a combination of automated systems and human moderators to try and keep the platform safe. However, 
                the challenge lies in finding a balance between content moderation and censorship while keeping the platform safe and enjoyable to use.

              </p>


              <p>
                Twitter has also been seen as a platform for people to be more radical with their speech in order to draw attention to their page and their ideas.
                 This can be seen in the rise of the so-called 'cancel culture', where people are more likely to express extreme opinions in order to get noticed 
                 and gain followers. However, while some people may think they are helping spread their message by being more radical, this can actually have the 
                 opposite effect.

              </p>


              <p>
                Overall Twitter has become a platform for negativity, with users engaging in hateful and cruel behaviour with impunity. This is largely due to 
                the platform's Anonymity and lack of moderation, as well as the lack of consequences for users who engage in abusive behaviour. While Twitter can 
                be a powerful platform for communication, it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of the platform and the prevalence of cyberbullying
                , harassment, and hate speech. 

              </p>



              <p>

                Furthermore, the rise of 'cancel culture' has only exacerbated this problem, as people are more likely to express extreme opinions in order
                 to gain followers. Therefore, it is important for Twitter to take greater steps to ensure that its platform remains a safe and enjoyable place 
                 for all users.



              </p>
