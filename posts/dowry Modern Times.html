              <p><span class="firstcharacter">D</span>owry  is a tradition practised in many African cultures for centuries. It is a custom where the 
                groom's family pays the bride's family a sum of money or goods to marry the bride. In some African cultures, the Dowry may be considered
                 a form of payment for the bride's family, and in others, it may be seen as a way of honouring the bride's family. In various 
                 communities, the Dowry is seen as a way to unite two families and show respect for the bride's family. In many cases, the Dowry can
                  also be a way to ensure that the bride's 
                family has some economic security in the event of the bride's death or widowhood. </p>

              <figure class="my-4">
                <img src="../assets/img/dowry.png" alt="" class="img-fluid">
                
              </figure>
              <p>However, paying Dowry has also been criticised in some parts of Africa. Critics argue that the practice perpetuates 
                gender inequality and reinforces the notion that women are commodities that can be bought and sold. It is also seen as 
                a way to put financial pressure on the groom's family, and it can lead to more dowry-related violence.
                 Despite the criticism, the practice of Dowry is still widely practised in many parts of Africa, and it is likely to 
                 remain so for many years.
              </p>
              
              <p>In contrast to the African practice of Dowry, the tradition of giving a dowry is not practised in many Western countries. 
                Some countries have even legislated against the practice of Dowry altogether. In the United States, for example, 
                <a href="https://legalreadings.com/the-dowry-prohibition-act-1961/" target="_blank"> the The Dowry
                  Prohibition Act, 1961,</a> makes it illegal to give or receive a dowry. In some countries, such as India, the practice of 
                dowry is still very much alive and is a major problem faced by many families. 
                </p>

               <p> The primary reason for this is that the practice of Dowry has been linked to gender inequality, and some countries have sought 
                to eliminate the practice to promote gender equality and empower women. 
                 <br /> <br />
                The practice of Dowry also has implications for sexual purity. In many parts of Africa, Dowry is seen as a way to ensure
                 that the bride is of good character and is a virgin when she enters the marriage. The idea is that by paying a dowry, 
                 the bride's family demonstrates that they have provided a good education and upbringing for the bride and that the bride is 
                 of good moral character. 
                </p> 

                <p>
                  This practice has recently been called into question by some social media users. For example, a popular tweet from a user in Kenya
                   reads: <a href="https://twitter.com/amerix/status/1423916823880339459" target="_blank">‚ÄúMen, in the days of our forefathers, 
                    dowry was paid before marriage, this was agreeable because women preserved their purity.
                    But today, the sex market is dirty & sluttery is rampant. So, pregnancy first. Fertilize. Pay dowry 3 years later.  SAVE A MAN." </a>  
                    This sentiment has been echoed by many other social media users, 
                  who argue that the practice of Dowry is outdated and should be abolished.
                </p>


                <p>
                  The impacts of modern culture on the practice of Dowry are far-reaching. In many parts of Africa, the tradition of Dowry is still 
                  seen as a necessary step in the marriage process. However, many young people are beginning to challenge this traditional view, 
                  leading to a shift in attitudes toward the practice.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This has been a hot topic on Twitter in Kenya, with many users voicing their opinions. One user wrote, 
                  <a href="https://twitter.com/Letter_to_Jack/status/1584086789668544512" target="_blank">  ‚ÄúDowry payments has outlived its importance 
                    in the modern world. It was only important 
                    in a world where Patriarchy was the norm.‚Äù
                  </a>
                   This tweet reflects the growing sentiment that Dowry
                   is an outdated practice and should be abolished. 
                </p>


                <p>
                  Dowry has long been associated with gender inequality in many parts of the world. The practice of Dowry reinforces the
                   idea that women are commodities that can be bought and sold, and it is often seen as a way to put financial pressure 
                   on the groom‚Äôs family. In some parts of the world, the practice of Dowry has been linked to violence against women, and
                    it has been suggested that the practice should be abolished to promote gender equality.
                On social media, many Kenyan users have been vocal in their opposition to the practice of Dowry, with some urging the
                 government to take action to tackle the issue.

                </p>

                <p>
                  One tweet reads, <a href="https://twitter.com/sirwakinya/status/1266451426387075073" target="_blank"> ‚ÄúAs a feminist, I
                     strongly believe bride price (dowry)  should be abolished. It objectifies women 
                    and therefore positions them as inferior üòÑ‚Äù. </a> This tweet reflects the sentiment that Dowry is a practice that
                     reinforces
                   gender inequality, and is something that should be tackled by the government.

                </p>

                <p>
                  Dowry is also seen as a way to provide financial security for the bride's family during her death or widowhood.
                   In some parts of the world, the practice of Dowry is seen as a way to ensure that the bride's family will be
                    financially secure after the marriage. For this reason, some families may pay a larger dowry to ensure that the
                     bride's family will have enough money to support themselves in the event of her death or widowhood. 

                </p>

                <p>
                  The financial security associated with Dowry has also been the subject of much debate on social media. For example, 
                  one user tweeted,  <a href="https://twitter.com/MasculineClass/status/1543069474064138240" target="_blank">"Dear Men, don‚Äôt be pressured and stressed to pay huge amount of dowry. Evaluate the worth and the 
                    character of the woman. If she doesn't fit the quotation price just walk away. Don't pay huge amount of dowry and go 
                    to sleep hungry at your house. Evaluate.‚Äù </a>
                   This tweet is encouraging men not to be pressured into paying Dowry and 
                  highlights the negative financial impact that it can have.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Apart from providing financial security, the practice of Dowry is also associated with the relationship between in-laws.
                   Typically, the groom's family will pay a dowry to the bride's family in exchange for their daughter's hand in marriage.
                    This exchange of money is seen as a way to demonstrate the groom's family's commitment to the marriage, as well as 
                    to establish a relationship of mutual respect and understanding between the two families. Various social media users
                     have discussed how Dowry can be a source of tension between the two families, as the bride's family may feel that
                      they are not being respected by the groom's family if the dowry is not paid. One user tweeted, 
                      <a href="https://twitter.com/Tabu3579/status/1383434294991802371" target="_blank"> "One man in my villag
                        e in lugari was deceived into buying land next to her wife's matrimonial home, worse of,he hadn't paid dowry,the 
                        Brother in-laws evicted him and took over the land,not sure how it unfolded later on."  </a>
                     
                      This tweet is an example 
                      of how the practice of Dowry can be used to manipulate and control the relationship between in-laws.

                </p>

                <p>
                  In conclusion, the practice of Dowry is still relevant in the 21st Century, although it is increasingly being 
                  challenged in some parts of the world. Critics argue that the practice reinforces gender inequality, and in some 
                  countries, it is even illegal. On social media, many users have voiced their opposition to the practice, arguing 
                  that it should be abolished in order to promote gender equality. Despite the criticism, the practice of Dowry is
                  still widely practiced in many parts of Africa, and it is likely to remain so for many years.
