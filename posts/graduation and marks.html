                 see the light at the end of the tunnel. However, their journey is not as smooth as they thought it would be. They are
                  faced with a final obstacle, known as “the grades for graduation,” which stands in the way of completing their journey. 
                  Although they have worked hard for four years, they must overcome this last hurdle in order to receive their marks and
                   graduate.

              </figure>


              <p>
                It was one month ago when the school released a memo about the graduation fee. One student narrates that he was
                 already struggling to pay his school fees, so when he heard that he had to pay an additional 6500 KES for the
                  graduation fee, he was heartbroken. He did not know how he was going to come up with the money. He knew that 
                  if he didn't graduate, he wouldn't be able to get a good job and provide for his family. He was determined to find
                   a way to graduate.

              </p>

              <p>
                The student started following up with the lecturers to see if he could get his missing marks. But most of the
                 lecturers were uncooperative. Some of them even told him that they did not have the marks. The student then went to 
                 the chairperson of the department and he helped him search for the booklets. The student finally managed to get all 
                 the booklets and he filled out the missing mark form. He forwarded it to the COD and he was finally able to graduate.

              </p>

              <p>
                The student says that the process was excessively complicated and bureaucratic. He had to go through a lot of hoops
                 just to get his missing marks. But in the end, it was all worth it because he was able to graduate. He continued by 
                 saying that this is just a glimpse of the challenges that university students face.

              <h3>A Story About Students Not Graduating Without Marks
              </h3>

              <p>
                Twitter is a platform that has been used to discuss this topic extensively. A popular tweet about this read,
                <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://twitter.com/XivTroy/status/1341999670466379777" target="_blank">
                  " Why do Kenyan universities make the graduation process so cumbersome for its students? This is an individual that
                  completed their program, applied for graduation, then in the last minute, after ignoring all forms of inquiry, you 
                  tell them they can't graduate coz of missing marks.”
                </a>
                  This tweet resonated with many people, highlighting the harsh 
                  reality many university students in Kenya face.

              </p>

              <p>
                The plight of university students in Kenya is a factual and pressing issue. The stories shared on Twitter highlight the 
                challenges many students face and the need for more support. We must continue to raise awareness about this issue and
                 provide support for those who are affected by it.
                 <br /> 
                The story of university students in Kenya not being able to graduate without marks is very emotional. It is one that
                 many people can relate to, as it highlights the challenges that many students face. 

              </p>

              <h3> How the Kenyan university marks system works</h3>

              <p>
                The process of getting marks from university exams can be quite complicated and bureaucratic. It starts with the students 
                taking their exams and then submitting their answer booklets to the invigilators. The invigilators then send the answer
                 booklets 
                to the markers. The marking has to be done in a fair and transparent manner. So, the exam papers are first marked within
                 the school 
                then after that, they are sent to an external body for moderation. This process can take quite a long time, sometimes even
                 months.
                 And during this time, the student has no idea how they did in the exam and whether 
                they will pass or fail. 
              </p>

              <p>
                This process is long and complicated because it involves many people and many steps. It can be very confusing for students
                 to keep track of their answer booklets and to know when they will receive their grades. Sometimes, the answer booklets get
                  lost and the students have to go to their various departments to follow up with their respective lecturers.

              </p>

              <p>
                The system is designed to ensure that students who have completed their studies at Kenyan universities receive the 
                marks they earned. However, the Kenyan university marks system has been criticized by some students who have accused
                 the system of being unfair and causing them to miss out on marks.

              </p>

              <p>
                One of the main criticisms is that it can lead to some students missing marks in some units. This is because the exam 
                papers are handled manually and are only sometimes perfect. In some cases, the university may have a different number 
                of answer scripts for all the students who have completed the exam. This can lead to some students needing to get their 
                answer scripts marked. 
              </p>


              <p>
                One of the students posted on Twitter, 
                <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://twitter.com/eugene_chingy/status/1067646114583711745" target="_blank">"What is going on at Moi University is just but a sneak peak into 
                  the situation in public universities in Kenya. 'Mistaken discontinuation,' missing marks, name it. 
                  Unfortunate thing 
                  is victims always have no one to listen to them. No one ever takes responsibility." </a>
                
                
                This student is not the only one 
                who has faced this problem. Many students have complained about this issue on social media.

              </p>

              <p>
                Consequently, the system has led to many students needing to graduate on time. Sometimes, students have had to wait
                 for months to get their results. This has caused a lot of frustration among students. In one tweet, a student said, 
                 <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://twitter.com/Joseph_Joecoolo/status/1479296575562260482" target="_blank"> "There's NOTHING more STRESSFUL like GRADUATING from a PUBLIC UNIVERSITY in Kenya. The search 
                  for MISSING MARKS is a
                  near DEATH experience!! Then there's the REAL HUSTLE in the search for a JOB thereafter!! You got to have the 
                  proverbial
                   nine lives of a cat to survive."  </a>
                
                    As per the comments on this post, it is clear that this student is not alone in her 
                   frustration.

              </p>


              <h3>
                How The Marks System Is Connected with Corruption, Sexual Harassment
              </h3>


              <p>
                According to a <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://www.u4.no/publications/education-sector-corruption-how-to-assess-it-and-ways-to-address-it" 
                target="_blank"> recent study</a> , the Kenyan university marks system is connected with corruption and sexual harassment.
                 The study found that university professors are more likely to give higher marks to students who engage in sexual 
                 relationships with them.  

              </p>

              <p>
                This issue is majorly rampant among the graduating class who are seeking to get good grades. To graduate, they must have 
                all the marks across all the units taken. Some students have gone to the extreme of offering sexual 
                favours to their professors to get good grades.
              </p>


              <p>
                The study has caused an uproar on social media, with many Kenyans calling for reform of the university system. 
                Some Twitter users have called for a complete overhaul of the education system, while others have called for more
                 transparency and accountability. One of the users tweeted, 
                 <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://twitter.com/nobnyandire/status/1196723416302342144" target="_blank"> "In most cases beautiful girls in
                   campus experience a 
                  lot of Missing marks one wonders why, later on they are forced to give either money or Sex to get marks for papers 
                  they sat for and passed for them to graduate.” </a>
                

              </p>


              <p>
                Another user tweeted,
                <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://twitter.com/loveablekathia/status/1550522267712593921" target="_blank">"University management in Kenya are aware of the sex for grades/missing marks issue, 
                  but they have chosen to Normalize the abuse of young men and women." </a>
                  This is a very emotional tweet that speaks
                 to the reality of what is happening in Kenyan universities. Many parents send their children to university with the 
                 hope that they will get a good education and be able to get good jobs after graduation. However, the reality is that
                  many students are being sexually harassed and are not getting the quality education they deserve.

              </p>


              <p>
                To conclude, many university students in Kenya face significant challenges, including not graduating because of 
                the "missing marks" issue. These challenges were highlighted in a 
                
                <a class="tweetLinks" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CampusMeTooDialogueKe?src=hashtag_click" target="_blank">   recent Twitter thread, 
                
                </a>
               
                emphasising the need for
                 more student assistance in Kenya. It is time for the Kenyan government to take action to reform the university system 
                 as it needs to be more transparent and accountable. Only then will students be able to get the quality education they
                  deserve.

              </p>
